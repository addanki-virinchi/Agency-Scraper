# Deduplication Implementation for Improved.py

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive deduplication logic to prevent reprocessing URLs from previous runs and ensure data integrity in output CSV files.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Existing URL Loading** ✅
```python
def load_existing_urls(all_urls_csv, filtered_csv):
    """Load existing URLs from both CSV files to avoid duplicates"""
    existing_urls = set()
    
    # Load from all_scraped_urls.csv
    # Load from filtered_places.csv
    # Return combined unique set
```

**Features:**
- Loads URLs from both output CSV files at startup
- Combines into a single set for efficient O(1) lookup
- Handles missing files gracefully
- Reports count of loaded URLs

### 2. **Duplicate Detection During Scraping** ✅
```python
# Check if URL already exists in previous runs
if url in existing_urls:
    skipped_urls_count += 1
    print(f"⏭️ Skipping URL (already processed): {url[:80]}...")
    continue
```

**Features:**
- Checks each scraped URL against existing set
- Skips processing if URL already exists
- Logs skipped URLs for transparency
- Maintains counters for reporting

### 3. **Incremental Set Updates** ✅
```python
# Add to existing URLs set to prevent duplicates within this session
existing_urls.add(url)
```

**Features:**
- Adds new URLs to the existing set immediately
- Prevents duplicates within the same scraping session
- Maintains consistency across multiple search items

### 4. **Dual CSV Writing** ✅
```python
# Append to all_scraped_urls.csv immediately
pd.DataFrame([url_data]).to_csv(all_urls_csv, mode='a', header=False, index=False)

# Also append to filtered CSV if within 7km
if within_7km == "YES":
    pd.DataFrame([url_data]).to_csv(filtered_csv, mode='a', header=False, index=False)
```

**Features:**
- Writes to `all_scraped_urls.csv` for every new URL
- Writes to `filtered_places.csv` only for URLs within 7km
- Maintains append mode to preserve existing data
- No file overwrites - all data is preserved

### 5. **Enhanced Logging** ✅
```python
print(f"✅ Search '{search_item}' completed:")
print(f"   - New URLs processed: {new_urls_count}")
print(f"   - URLs skipped (duplicates): {skipped_urls_count}")
print(f"   - Total URLs found this session: {len(urls_data)}")
```

**Features:**
- Reports new URLs vs skipped URLs for each search
- Shows deduplication efficiency
- Provides clear progress tracking

## File Structure

### Input File: `maps_results.csv`
```csv
search_item,latitude,longitude
"IELTS Coaching in Connaught Place, Delhi",28.6315,77.2167
```

### Output File 1: `all_scraped_urls.csv`
```csv
search_item,search_lat,search_lon,url,url_lat,url_lon,distance_km,within_7km
"IELTS Coaching...",28.6315,77.2167,"https://maps.google.com/...",28.6291,77.2249,2.5,YES
```

### Output File 2: `filtered_places.csv`
```csv
search_item,search_lat,search_lon,url,url_lat,url_lon,distance_km,within_7km
"IELTS Coaching...",28.6315,77.2167,"https://maps.google.com/...",28.6291,77.2249,2.5,YES
```
*(Only contains URLs where within_7km = "YES")*

## Usage Workflow

### First Run:
1. **No existing files** - Creates new CSV files with headers
2. **Scrapes URLs** - Processes all found URLs
3. **Writes to both CSVs** - All URLs to first file, filtered to second
4. **Reports results** - Shows total URLs processed

### Subsequent Runs:
1. **Loads existing URLs** - Reads from both CSV files
2. **Skips duplicates** - Checks each URL against existing set
3. **Processes only new URLs** - Saves time and prevents duplicates
4. **Appends to existing files** - Preserves all previous data
5. **Reports efficiency** - Shows new vs skipped URLs

## Example Output

```
🚀 Starting scraping process...
📄 Output files: all_scraped_urls.csv (all URLs), filtered_places.csv (filtered URLs)
📋 Loaded 150 existing URLs from all_scraped_urls.csv
🎯 Loaded 45 existing URLs from filtered_places.csv
🔍 Total unique URLs already processed: 150

🔍 Searching for: IELTS Coaching in Connaught Place, Delhi
📍 Search center: 28.6315, 77.2167
🌐 Loading: https://www.google.com/maps/search/...

  📍 Scroll 1/10: Found 15 unique place elements
    ⏭️ Skipping URL #1 (already processed): https://www.google.com/maps/place/...
    ⏭️ Skipping URL #2 (already processed): https://www.google.com/maps/place/...
    🔗 Processing NEW URL #3: https://www.google.com/maps/place/...
    ✅ Coordinates extracted: 28.6291627, 77.2249081
    📊 Distance: 2.5 km | Within 7km: YES

✅ Search 'IELTS Coaching in Connaught Place, Delhi' completed:
   - New URLs processed: 5
   - URLs skipped (duplicates): 10
   - Total URLs found this session: 5

📊 FINAL SUMMARY:
   - Total URLs scraped: 5
   - URLs within 7 km: 3
   - Filtering efficiency: 60.0%
```

## Benefits

1. **No Data Loss** - All previous scraping work is preserved
2. **Efficient Processing** - Skips already processed URLs
3. **Real-time Monitoring** - See progress and deduplication in action
4. **Data Integrity** - No duplicate URLs in output files
5. **Resumable Process** - Can stop and restart without losing progress
6. **Clear Reporting** - Know exactly what's new vs what's skipped

## Testing

Run the deduplication test:
```bash
python test_deduplication.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Created test files:
🔍 Deduplication test results:
   - Total unique URLs loaded: 2
   - Expected: 2 unique URLs
   - Test result: ✅ PASS
```

The implementation ensures robust deduplication while maintaining all the enhanced debugging and coordinate extraction features from the previous fixes.
